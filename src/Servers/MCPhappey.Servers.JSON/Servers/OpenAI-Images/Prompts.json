Analyze the input data provided below (which may be text, records, logs, or any kind of structured or unstructured information).\n\nTASK\n1. Identify all **facts and insights** that would be most relevant and visually appealing for an infographic. These can include key numbers, statistics, percentages, rankings, trends, correlations, timelines, categories, or yes/no flags.\n2. Summarize each insight in a short, catchy, and visually friendly way—each as a concise label with value and optional unit or context, suitable for a data card, chart, or icon in an infographic.\n3. Focus on 4–8 of the most impactful and interesting insights, so the output is visually rich but not crowded.\n4. Leave out anything too uncertain, verbose, or not visually useful.\n\nOUTPUT\nList the extracted facts and insights as **plain text bullets**, ready for use in an infographic. Use a clear, visually-oriented style (short label, value, unit/context if helpful) and no prose, paragraphs, or explanations.",
