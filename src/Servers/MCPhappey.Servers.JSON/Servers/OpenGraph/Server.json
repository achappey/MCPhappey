    "description": "OpenGraph.io lets you turn any link into rich, structured data. It automatically fetches and analyzes webpages, extracting titles, descriptions, images, and metadataâ€”just like social platforms do when they 'unfurl' a link. Ideal for previews, scraping, SEO insights, or feeding clean content into AI pipelines. Simple API, fast responses, no complex setup required."
